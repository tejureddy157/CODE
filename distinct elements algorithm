Algorithm for Printing Distinct Elements in an Array
Input: An array of integers arr of size n.
Output: Prints distinct elements in the array arr.

Step 1: Start a loop from i = 0 to n-1 to iterate through each element of the array arr.
Step 2: Inside the outer loop, initialize a variable j to iterate from 0 to i-1.
Step 3: For each element arr[i], check if it is equal to any of the previous elements arr[j] (where j < i).
Step 4: If a duplicate is found (i.e., arr[i] == arr[j]), break out of the inner loop using break.
Step 5: After the inner loop, if j equals i, it means arr[i] is distinct (not found before in the previous elements).
Step 6: Print arr[i] as it is a distinct element.
Step 7: Repeat steps 1-6 until all elements of the array arr have been processed.
